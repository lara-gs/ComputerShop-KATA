# Computer Store Project

This project aims to model a computer store. The store has attributes such as name, owner, and tax ID, while the computers available in the store have attributes like brand, memory size, processor features, operating system, and price.

## Store Attributes
- **Store Name**
- **Store Owner**
- **Store Tax ID**
- **List of Computers Available**

## Computer Attributes
- **Computer Brand**
- **Memory Size**
- **Processor Features**
- **Operating System**
- **Computer Price**

## Functionalities
The program should have methods that allow performing the following actions:
- Add a computer to the store.
- Remove a computer from the store by its brand.
- Search for a computer in the store by its brand.
- List all computers available in the store.

## Requirements
- **UML Class Diagram**: A UML class diagram showing the relationship between `Store` and `Computer` classes.
- **Unit Tests Required**: A minimum of 70% unit test coverage.

## Deliverables
- **GitHub Repository**: The code must be stored in a public GitHub repository.
- **Class Diagram Screenshot**: Include a screenshot of the class diagram generated on [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net) or a public link to the file.
- **Test Coverage Screenshot**: Include a screenshot of the test coverage section from VSCode that shows the test coverage has been met.
